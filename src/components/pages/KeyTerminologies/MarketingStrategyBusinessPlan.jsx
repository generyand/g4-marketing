            Tesla's marketing strategy focuses on innovation, sustainability,
            and premium electric vehicles. Their business plan began by
            targeting high-end cars to build a luxury brand, later funding more
            affordable models like the Model 3. This combination of a strong
            marketing strategy and scalable business plan has made Tesla a
            leader in the electric vehicle market.
